<h2>Correlation and Regression</h2>
<p>Correlation and regression are statistical techniques to quantify and describe the relationship between variables. Correlation quantifies the strength and type of relationship, whereas regression expresses the relationship in the form of an equation that enables us to predict the value and relationship of unseen variables.</p>

<p>
The task was to run the shared programmes in the Jupyter Notebook download from the Essex Software Hub or via Google Colab and change variables as needed to observe how the change in data points impacts correlation and regression.
