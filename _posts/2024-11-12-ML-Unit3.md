<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p>Correlation and regression are statistical techniques to quantify and describe the relationship between variables. Correlation quantifies the strength and type of relationship, whereas regression expresses the relationship in the form of an equation that enables us to predict the value and relationship of unseen variables.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This unit covers the correlation and regression analysis. We dealt with techniques for uncovering relationships within data and building predictive models.</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of this unit, I could perform correlation analyses and build regression models. These are highly required skills for data-driven decisions in any area</p>
