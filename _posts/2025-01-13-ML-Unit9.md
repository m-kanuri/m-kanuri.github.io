<h2>CNN Model Activity</h2>
<p>Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.
Run this CNN model - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Object Recognition.ipynb - and review different sections of the algorithm. Change the input image for prediction by changing the value of this variable - plt.imshow(x_test[16] - from 16 to value of your choice (1-15) and see whether the model predicts correctly.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> This unit covered Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their use in image recognition. We looked into the architecture of CNNs and their applications in real life.</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of this unit, I gained an understanding of CNNs and their applications, especially in image processing and computer vision.</p>
