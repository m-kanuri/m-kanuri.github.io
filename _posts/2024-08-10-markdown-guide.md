Using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset, assess the level of anti-social behaviour that the survey respondents experience in their neighbourhood by creating a summary statistic, using the ‘antisocx’ variable.

The ‘antisocx’ variable captures the level of anti-social behavior experienced by respondents.
