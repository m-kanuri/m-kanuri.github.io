<h2>Perceptron</h2>
<p>
    Perceptron is a simple artificial neuron that helps machines make decisions. It is a binary classifier (used for supervised learning) that decides whether something belongs to one category or another. 
    The first neural network model, Perceptron, was designed in 1958. Perceptron learning combines two concepts: the McCulloch-Pitts model of an artificial neuron and the Hebbian learning rule of adjusted weights. 
    There are different types of Perceptrons, like Single Layer Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

    The simple perceptron produces outputs of either 0 or 1. A single-layer perceptron (without hidden layers) was trained to perform binary classification for the AND operation. 
    In contrast, a multi-layer perceptron, utilizing a hidden layer and sigmoid activation function, was used to solve the XOR problem.
