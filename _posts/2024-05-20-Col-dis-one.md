## Summary Post: AI is powering the future of financial services

In my initial post, I discussed the advantages of AI in financial services, including customer experience, detecting fraudulent activities, and preventing financial crime.

Khadijah Harding's concern about potential irregularities caused by using AI in financial services is a pivotal point that merits our collective attention. Financial institutions continuously invest in AI tools to mitigate risks and avoid fraud and data misuse. Governments are amending policies to ensure that there are enough regulations for using AI in the financial industry.

Andrei Tapu's post has significantly broadened our discussion, particularly with his insightful observations on the advantages of AI in investment platforms. His points, notably how AI tools can automatically rebalance portfolios and adapt to market fluctuations, are intriguing and offer practical solutions that can make investing more accessible for beginners, thereby enhancing overall financial well-being. 

I've had the privilege of engaging with Paul Dogar's insightful posts on AI in marketing, Jaafar El Komati's enlightening post on the importance of AI in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) companies, Martyna Antas's thought-provoking post on AI in translation, and Stuart Gibb's informative post on the intersection of Quality Assurance and Artificial Intelligence. These contributions have enriched our discussion and fostered a sense of community in our shared interest in AI applications. 

- In Architecture, engineering, and construction companies, AI algorithms are not just capable of generating optimised designs. They can do so by analysing vast amounts of data and considering crucial factors such as structural integrity, material efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
- In quality assurance, AI-powered testing tools are instrumental in identifying coding issues, UI issues, standard error handling, and more. Identifying defects in the early stages of development helps reduce the cost of fixing them later. However, an element of quality assurance professional intervention is still required to meet the demands of the project sponsors.
- AI-powered tools can make translation quicker and more cost-effective. However, there are a few challenges in translating legal documents, and specific language translations still need to be corrected, highlighting the need for human intervention and oversight.
- AI in marketing is a theoretical and powerful tool for predicting sales and influencing customer behaviours with big data. This insight empowers companies to influence future results and adjust their marketing strategies and tactics based on those, which can lead to tangible and better outcomes. 

The same is covered in Unit 1, which talks about using AI in various applications, AI in medicine and Healthcare, AI in Fintech, and challenges with artificial intelligence. The topics covered in Unit 2 are pretty interestingâ€”implications of AI and Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety. The Unit 2 seminar was informative and gave us a clear understanding of artificial intelligence in Industry 4.0 and 5.0. The concepts in Unit 3 helped in understanding the agent types and types of learning from feedback and provided extensive information on the Turing Test and Neural Network architectures.
