<h2>Overview</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this unit, I explored the foundations of quantitative methods used in business research and data analysis. The focus was on understanding how data can be collected, organised, and summarised using descriptive statistics. I developed a clearer understanding of how numerical data can be transformed into meaningful insights through graphical and statistical techniques.</p>
