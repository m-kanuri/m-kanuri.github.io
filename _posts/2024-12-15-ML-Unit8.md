<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Training neural networks,deep dive into backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms were covered in this unit</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>I gained the ability to train neural networks, tune model parameters, and optimize their performance.</p>

<h2>e-Portfolio Activity : Gradient Cost Function</h2>
<p> The task was to run the tutorial: gradient_descent_cost_function.ipynb by changing the iteration number and learning_rate and observing how cost decreases.

<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2: Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications</h2>
<p>
The Discussion is based on reading/listening to the article by Hutson (2021) in Nature on Robo-writers. The task was to post a response and provide a peer response, followed by a Summary post.
