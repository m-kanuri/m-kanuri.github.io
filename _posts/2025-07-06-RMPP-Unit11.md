<p style="text-align: justify;"> Carrying out reflections on your learning during the various modules would have provided you with some insight on how you learn and how that impacts your professional practice. This should be the basis for the completion of your professional skills matrix, leading to the development of an action plan that should prove useful to you beyond your degree programme (CPD, Continuous Professional Development).

A crucial aspect of CPD is represented by industry certifications, which can keep your knowledge relevant and up to date, and develop essential, technical aspects of your professional practice. Links to some of the main industry-recognised certifications are available in the reading section of this module, organised by themes/subject areas.</p>
