# Data Activity 3

Using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset (see Unit 1), perform the following activity:

Create a subset of individuals who belong to the ‘75+’ age group and who were a ‘victim of crime’ that occurred in the previous 12 months. Save this dataset under a new name 'crime_75victim'.

The data is downloaded from [ Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8011#!/access-data)

NumPy is the numerical library in Python. Used Google Colab to work on this activity.

1. Loading Data: We loaded the SPSS file csew1314teachingopen.sav into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Filtering Data: We filtered the dataset to include only individuals aged 75+ who were victims of crime in the last 12 months.
3. Saving Data: We saved the filtered data as a new SPSS file named [crime_75victim.sav](https://github.com/m-kanuri/m-kanuri.github.io/blob/ad43e2af50b0b4df599c14244b12c7c4291f81fa/crime_75victim.sav)
