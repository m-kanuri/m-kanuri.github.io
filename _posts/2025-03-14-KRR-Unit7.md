<h2>Assignment Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>This assignment requires you to critically analyse the paper ‘A curated ontology-based large-scale knowledge graph of artificial intelligence tasks and benchmarks’ by Kathrin Blagec (Blagec, K., Barbosa-Silva, A., Ott, S. & Samwald, M. (2022) A curated, ontology-based, large-scale knowledge graph of artificial intelligence tasks and benchmarks.), which introduces the Intelligence Task Ontology (ITO). The paper addresses the growing complexity of AI research, focusing on task classification, benchmarking, and performance metrics within a structured, ontology-based framework. Your task is to assess and discuss the methodology, application, and implications of ITO in the landscape of AI research and development.</li>
