<h2> Activity Guidance </h2>
<h3>Deep Learning in Action</h3>
<ul>
 <li> You are required to research an application of Deep Learning that you think is going to have an impact on society (whether that is positive or negative). When you have found your application you should make a post on the discussion forum that covers:.</li>
  <li>  An overview of the technology (e.g., what it does).</li>
 <li> A brief synopsis of how it works.</li>
 <li> The potential impacts this will have in terms of ethics, privacy, social good, or any other socio-technical aspects that you feel are relevant.</li>
 <li> Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</li>

</ul>
