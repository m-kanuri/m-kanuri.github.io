<h2>Collaborative Discussion 3: Deep Learning </h2>

<h3>Discussion Topic: Deep Learning</h3>
  
<p>The advent of new technologies supported by Deep Learning models mean that it is now possible to generate ‘new’ content, for example, Dall-E AI to generate images or ChatGPT to create prose.

Do you think that these new technologies offer any ethical issues that should be considered, and if not, why not?</p>

<h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> The knowledge and skills required to develop, deploy and evaluate the tools and techniques of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Activity Guidance </h3>
<ul>
 <li> You are required to research an application of Deep Learning that you think is going to have an impact on society (whether that is positive or negative). When you have found your application you should make a post on the discussion forum that covers:.</li>
  <li>  An overview of the technology (e.g., what it does).</li>
 <li> A brief synopsis of how it works.</li>
 <li> The potential impacts this will have in terms of ethics, privacy, social good, or any other socio-technical aspects that you feel are relevant.</li>
 <li> Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</li>

</ul>
