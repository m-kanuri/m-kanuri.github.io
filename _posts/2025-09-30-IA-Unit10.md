<h2> Formative Activities </h2>
<h3> Collaborative Discussion 3: Deep Learning  </h3>
<p>Collaborative Learning Discussion 3 (Continued). Review and respond to the discussion in Unit 9. Please try to limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as 'Peer Response'. </p>

<h2> Activity Guidance </h2>
<h3>Deep Learning in Action</h3>
<ul>
 <li> You are required to research an application of Deep Learning that you think is going to have an impact on society (whether that is positive or negative). When you have found your application you should make a post on the discussion forum that covers:.</li>
  <li>  An overview of the technology (e.g., what it does).</li>
 <li> A brief synopsis of how it works.</li>
 <li> The potential impacts this will have in terms of ethics, privacy, social good, or any other socio-technical aspects that you feel are relevant.</li>
 <li> Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</li>

</ul>
<h3> My Learning Outcomes </h3>
<h4>Outcome 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I explored how deep learning is transforming medical image analysis through applications such as automated diagnosis using CNNs. This helped me understand how these models learn from large datasets to identify diseases and assist clinicians in making faster, more consistent decisions.</p>
<h4>Outcome 2</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I reflected on the wider ethical and social implications of using AI in healthcare, including issues of bias, data privacy, and accountability. This activity made me realise that successful AI adoption in medicine requires not only technical accuracy but also transparency, fairness, and responsible governance.</p>
