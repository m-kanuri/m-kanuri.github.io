<li>A close friend.</li>
<li>A company’s annual report.</li>
<li>Your close friend’s partner whom you have yet to meet.</li>

<h2>Activity 2</h2>
<p>What would you suggest is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the ‘having information’ situations from the ‘knowing’ situations you categorised in the previous activity?
