<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Agent-Based Systems </h2>
<h3>Discussion Topic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations. Discussion should include at least three references.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> An understanding of the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing.</li>
  <li>An understanding of the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assignment Guidance </h3>
<ul>
 <li> Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'.</li>
 <li> You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in Unit 2 (each labelled as 'Peer Response').  To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas.</li>
 <li> In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.</li>
</ul>

<h3> My Learning Outcomes </h3>

<h4>Outcome 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explored the key properties of intelligent agents' autonomy, reactivity, proactiveness, and social ability and their role in modern distributed systems. Understood how agents perceive and act within their environments using sensors and actuators, and how these characteristics underpin agent-based architectures in real-world applications.</p>

<h4>Outcome 2</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Examined how the rise of agent-based systems has been driven by the need for scalable, flexible, and adaptive solutions within Industry 4.0, IoT, and multi-agent environments. Reflected on how agents collaborate to achieve organisational goals through communication protocols such as KQML and FIPA-ACL.</p>

<h4>Outcome 3</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Integrated example case studies demonstrate the benefits of decentralisation and self-organisation in agent-based systems in terms of achieving robustness, efficiency, and responsiveness compared to classical monolithic systems. </p>

<h4>Outcome 4</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We debated the future of agent systems. Is agent technology in decline? Or is it hidden because it is a core to hybrid AI architectures? We discussed the philosophical and ethical aspects of autonomy and intelligence, focusing on communication as a primordial sign of intelligence.</p>

<h3>Module Wiki</h3>
  
<p>As you work through this module, you will inevitably come across terms and pieces of information which are novel and worth sharing. You can place such information in the Module Wiki to benefit the whole group. In the wiki, you can place a term/word/phrase, as well as its definition and/or any information you have sourced on the topic (clearly referenced).</p>
