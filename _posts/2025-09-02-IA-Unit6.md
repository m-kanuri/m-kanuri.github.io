<h2>e-Portfolio Element - Creating Agent Dialogues </h2>

<p> Create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).

Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.</p>

<h2>Development Team Project: Project Report </h2>

<h3>Full Brief</h3>

<p>
This assignment sees you positioned as a team of software consultants and specialists in agent design and development. You are required to develop an agent that is capable of performing tasks for an organisation with domain-specific requirements.
</p>

<p>
A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having a need to find certain files or content, the need to carry out some processing and a requirement to do something with the processed data. The requirements mean that one or more agents will need to work together to carry out these operations.
</p>

<p>The tasks that you should consider are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Digital Forensics</b>: Finding specific filetypes on a file system, archiving them and sending the results somewhere for analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Academic Research Online</b>: Finding results on a website based on search terms (e.g., social media or a search engine), extracting the data and sending to an offline location.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should choose a single task area to focus your development on and your system should be tailored to the requirements of this domain. In all domains you should develop one or more small programs (or agents) to carry out the tasks based on their own goals/desires/intentions.
</p>

<p><i>Domain and task mean the same thing and refer to either Digital Forensics or Academic Research Online.</i></p>

<h3>Success Criteria </h3>
<p>The agreed success criteria for successful development are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The agent can identify and retrieve data.</li>
  <li>The data is processed in some way.</li>
   <li>The processed information is stored/saved/presented.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Your team is expected to prepare and deliver a comprehensive design proposal report, describing how you will meet the requirements, design and implementation of the solution for the organisation.
</p>

<h3>Part 1: The Design Proposal Document</h3>

<p>The associated deliverables are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the full Grading Criteria (located in Module Resources):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>System requirements</b> – e.g., what libraries are required?</li>
  <li><b>Design decisions</b> – e.g., why have you made the choices that you have throughout the design process?</li>
  <li><b>Approaches</b> that you have adopted to create your system – e.g., what methodology will you use? Which development techniques and areas are you leveraging?</li>
  <li>Build up a rationale where appropriate supported by literature – explain why you have made your choices and evidence with appropriate references (<i>Knowledge and Understanding, 25%</i>).</li>
  <li>List the various <b>challenges</b> you have identified/expect to encounter when developing your agent. Highlight (briefly) what paradigm(s), pattern(s), theories and practices you intend to utilise on this project to address the challenges. Justify your approaches supported by literature (<i>Application of Knowledge, 25%</i>).</li>
  <li>Produce a minimum of <b>two different graphical designs</b> which illustrate different views of the system. This could use UML to model your system and present your designs, or any other visual approach that is appropriate (e.g., sequence diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams).</li>
  <li>Ensure that you produce a <b>business-ready proposal</b>, that is well structured with no typographical errors. It should present your recommendations in a clear and easy to read format and be proofread before submission (<i>Structure and Presentation, 25%</i>).</li>
  <li>Provide appropriate <b>justification</b> for any key design choices, including a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses (<i>Criticality, 25%</i>).</li>
  <li>Ensure your justifications for decisions made are based on <b>good academic principles</b> and that any academic sources you have used/referred to are clearly cited and that your references are presented in the required UoEO format.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> Appendices should not be used to extend the core report. Reports should stand alone, complete and concise. Appendices should only be used for supplementary/supporting information. A key part of this module is expressing ideas succinctly, concisely, and with necessary brevity.
</blockquote>

<h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
<ul>
  <li>An understanding of the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing.</li>
  <li>An understanding of the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.</li>
  <li>An understanding of contemporary research issues in the area of intelligent agent systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages </h2>

<h3>Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages</h3>
<p> Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 (Continued). Review and respond to the discussion in Unit 5. Please try to limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas. Your follow-up responses should be labelled as 'Peer Response'. </p>
<h3> My Learning Outcomes – Agent Communication Languages </h3>
