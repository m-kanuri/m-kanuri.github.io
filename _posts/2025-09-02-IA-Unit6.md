<h2>Development Team Project: Project Report </h2>

<h3>Full Brief</h3>

<p>
This assignment sees you positioned as a team of software consultants and specialists in agent design and development. You are required to develop an agent that is capable of performing tasks for an organisation with domain-specific requirements.
</p>

<p>
A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having a need to find certain files or content, the need to carry out some processing and a requirement to do something with the processed data. The requirements mean that one or more agents will need to work together to carry out these operations.
</p>

<p>The tasks that you should consider are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Digital Forensics</b>: Finding specific filetypes on a file system, archiving them and sending the results somewhere for analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Academic Research Online</b>: Finding results on a website based on search terms (e.g., social media or a search engine), extracting the data and sending to an offline location.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should choose a single task area to focus your development on and your system should be tailored to the requirements of this domain. In all domains you should develop one or more small programs (or agents) to carry out the tasks based on their own goals/desires/intentions.
</p>

<p><i>Domain and task mean the same thing and refer to either Digital Forensics or Academic Research Online.</i></p>


<h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> An understanding of the motivations for, and appropriate use of, agent-based computing.</li>
  <li>An understanding of the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Guidance </h3>
<ul>
 <li> Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'.</li>
 <li> You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in Unit 2 (each labelled as 'Peer Response').  To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas.</li>
 <li> In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.</li>
 <li> Referencing: When you have referred to other authors thoughts, ideas and opinions in your posts, you must reference the author as you would in an academic assignment using the UoEO Harvard reference style.</li>
 <li> You will be not be assessed on your contribution to this forum throughout the module, but the tutor will post group feedback via a module announcement.</li>
 <li> This activity forms a component of your e-portfolio which you will submit in Unit 12. All e-portfolio activities are intended to demonstrate your ability and strengths through evidence and reflection.</li>
</ul>
