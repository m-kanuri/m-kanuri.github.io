<h2>Discussion Topic</h2>
<p>Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon â€“ it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems.</p>

 <li>Discuss this assertion. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Justify your position, supported with at least two academics references.</li>

 <li>How is reasoning related to knowledge representation (KR)? Is KR still useful without reasoning support? Justify your answer supported by two academic references. </li>
