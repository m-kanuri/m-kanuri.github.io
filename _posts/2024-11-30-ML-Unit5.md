<h1>Clustering</h1>
    <p>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is the main task of exploratory data analysis and is used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics, and machine learning.</p>
    
  <p>The task was to share  thoughts on the relationships based on both animations in the module wiki (available in Module Resources) and comment on the peersâ€™ wiki posts. </p>

    <h2>Jaccard Coefficient Calculations</h2>
  
<p> A commonly used measure of overlap between sets A and B is the Jackcard Coefficient. </p>

<p> A table with the pathological test results for three individuals is provided and was asked to calculate the Jackcard Coefficient in pairs. </p>
