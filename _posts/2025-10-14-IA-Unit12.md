<h2> Individual e-Portfolio Submission </h2>
<h3>Assignment Details</h3>
<ul>
 <li> This assessment focuses on your reflections on being part of a development team and your individual contributions throughout this module, as well as your evaluation of your team's work in Unit 6. You will also need to include screenshots (or similar) of your individual contributions to the team projects - these are not applied to your word count for this submission. Please note that your reflections are not seen by other students, so you are free to discuss what is relevant to your learning and the processes you have gone through.</li>
  <li> Elaborating on the above, your e-Portfolio should consist of:</li>
 <li> Your answers to and outputs from exercises carried out during the module, including all your coding scripts and system designs.</li>
 <li> Your analysis of the data gathered, your contributions to the online forums, showing your analytical skills.</li>
 <li> Reflections on Intelligent agents based on your learnings in this module, focusing on the skills and knowledge you have gained during your evaluation of your final project.</li>
 <li> You have the option of presenting this as a video recording (with subtitles) or as written text. In creating the content, some people find a diary style approach helps. You can use this Reflection Toolkit from the University of Edinburgh to get further guidance on reflection. For example, you can use Rolfe et al.â€™s (2001) approach. You could start by providing a brief description of the project outcomes or critical incident (WHAT), analyse and interpret the information (SO WHAT) and then decide how you can use the information and learning from it (NOW WHAT). You can find out more about the structure of your reflection by visiting the e-portfolio page on the department site.</li>
  <li>If submitting a video, remember that you it need to include comprehensive subtitles (in English). The video recording can consist of a series of video logs recorded during the module, edited together to form a comprehensive video diary for final submission. Remember that this must flow as an integrated, comprehensive record of your experience on the module. If you choose to use a video format, you must also provide a transcript file and upload this into the submission portal below.</li>
