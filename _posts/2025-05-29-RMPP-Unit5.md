<h2>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for formative feedback.</p>

<h2>Wiki Activity: Questionnaires</h2>

<pp style="text-align: justify;">Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.

Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?

Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.</p>
