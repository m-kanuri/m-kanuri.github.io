<h2>Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages </h2>

<h3>Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages</h3>
  
<p>Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations. Discussion should include at least three references.</p>

<h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> An understanding of the main agent models in use today and their grounding in artificial intelligence research.</li>
  <li> The knowledge and skills required to develop, deploy and evaluate the tools and techniques of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.</li>
    <li> An understanding of contemporary research issues in the area of intelligent agent systems.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Assignment Guidance </h3>
<ul>
 <li> Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.  This should be labelled as 'Initial Post'.</li>
 <li> You will then respond to at least 2 of your peers' posts in Unit 2 (each labelled as 'Peer Response').  To guide your responses, look at the guidelines for the peer review process on the Department’s homepage. Focus on the possible measures that could have been put in place in order to prevent the incidents highlighted by your peers.  Please try to limit your response posts to 200-300 words maximum, so that others may be encouraged to reflect on, and respond to your ideas.</li>
 <li> In Unit 3, you should provide a summary post based on your initial post, the feedback from your peers and the content of the three units. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words.</li>

</ul>
<h3> My Learning Outcomes – Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages </h3>
<h4>Outcome 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developed a critical understanding of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) such as KQML and FIPA-ACL, recognising their role in enabling semantic interoperability and meaningful interaction between autonomous agents.</p>
<h4>Outcome 2</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through analysis and peer dialogue, explored how ACLs use performatives (e.g., inform, request, query-if) to convey intention, contrasting this with the directness and efficiency of method invocation in languages like Python or Java.</p>
<h4>Outcome 3</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Reflected on the trade-offs between expressiveness and complexity, identifying how ontology alignment, middleware, and hybrid communication models can balance flexibility and performance in distributed multi-agent systems. </p>
<h4>Outcome 4</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This discussion deepened my appreciation of communication as a defining characteristic of agent intelligence, bridging the gap between computational logic and social interaction in AI systems.</p>
