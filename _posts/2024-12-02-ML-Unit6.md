  <h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
  <p>At the end of the unit, I became confident in using Python to implement clustering algorithms, allowing me to analyse and use complex datasets effectively.</p>
  
<h2>Development Team Project</h2>
<p> Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present more unique, personalised ways of experiencing the world. The Airbnb dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv), along with its description, can be accessed through Kaggle. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019, which includes all needed information about hosts, geographical availability, and necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.</p>
