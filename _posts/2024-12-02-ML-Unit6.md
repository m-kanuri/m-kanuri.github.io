<h2>Development Team Project</h2>
<p> Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present more unique, personalised ways of experiencing the world. The Airbnb dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv), along with its description, can be accessed through Kaggle. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019, which includes all needed information about hosts, geographical availability, and necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.

This assignment is aimed at assessing your ability to pose interesting questions relevant to Airbnb business and process the data using the key steps of big data analytics, such as data pre-processing, analysing, and eventually preparing an analytical report. In order for your analysis to be compelling, it must address a substantive issue rather than a trivial one.
