   <h2>Overview - Unit 1 Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
  <p>This module covered the overview of machine learning (ML), exploring the different types like unsupervised, supervised, and reinforced learning. We examined the timeline of the Industrial Revolution, the impact on modern applications such as self-driving cars, and the classification of spam emails. Also, a big part of the discussion was about ethics in AI development.</p>
  
    <h2>Discussion Topic</h2>
    <p>Read the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab">Schwab (2016) article</a> from World Economic Forum and discuss the impact of Industry 4.0 on the sector in which you are involved or interested.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.</li>
        <li>Consider a range of impacts of the failure, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Implications to customers</li>
                <li>Economic cost</li>
                <li>Reputational cost</li>
                <li>Other relevant impacts</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Review <strong>Lecturecast 1</strong> and read the papers provided in the reference list.</li>
        <li>Go to the discussion forum and create an initial post of your contribution to the discussion.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate understanding of the topic and use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for using machine learning algorithms.</li>
        <li>Develop and implement skills to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
    </ul>
    
 <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
 <p>By completing the unit, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning and its application in real-world applications. I also actively contributed to the collaborative discussion on 4th Industrial Revolution.</p>
