<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p>This module covered the overview of machine learning (ML), exploring the different types like unsupervised, supervised, and reinforced learning. We examined the timeline of the Industrial Revolution, the impact on modern applications such as self-driving cars, and the classification of spam emails. Also, a big part of the discussion was about ethics in AI development.</p>
  
<h2>Colloborative Discussion</h2>
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab">Schwab (2016) article</a> from World Economic Forum and discuss the impact of Industry 4.0 on the sector in which you are involved or interested.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify a specific incident (not covered in your reading list) where the failure of an information system has had a significant impact.</li>
<li>Consider a range of impacts of the failure, including:
<ul>
<li>Implications to customers</li>
<li>Economic cost</li>
<li>Reputational cost</li>
<li>Other relevant impacts</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

 <h2>My Learnings</h2>
 <p>By completing the unit, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning and its application in real-world applications. I also actively contributed to the collaborative discussion on 4th Industrial Revolution.</p>
