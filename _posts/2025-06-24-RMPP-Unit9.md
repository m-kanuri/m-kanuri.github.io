<h2>Practicing Business Visualisation with PowerBI</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Practised Power BI concepts by completing quick practical training sessions focused on report design. This included learning basic Power BI commands and completing exercises in the lab. I downloaded the Power BI Desktop version and practised additional exercises.</p>
