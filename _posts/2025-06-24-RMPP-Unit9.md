       <td> Open the Excel workbook in Exe 9.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the
percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a
percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format
as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies
alongside that for Area 1.
Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand
preferences for each of the two demographic areas?</td>
