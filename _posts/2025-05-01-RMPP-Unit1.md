<h2>Activity 2</h2>
<p>What would you suggest is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the ‘having information’ situations from the ‘knowing’ situations you categorised in the previous activity? You will need to make sure that your description does not simply describe information or data but must particularly take account of the former.</p>

<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 </h2>
<p>Read the paper by Weststeijn, T. (2011) and then join the collaborative discussion below. Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon – it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems.

Discuss this assertion. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Justify your position, supported with at least two academics references.

How is reasoning related to knowledge representation (KR)? Is KR still useful without reasoning support? Justify your answer supported by two academic references.</p>
