## Final Submission: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solution Implementation

### Assignment Details

You are required to carry out an experiment using the WEKA software tool and the appropriate dataset available at UCI or Kaggle. You will need to demonstrate to the senior management of the start-up company discussed in Unit 9, the feasibility of the AI technology deployment in at least one of the key areas you identified in your Unit 9 report. It does not have to be an exact solution, but you must demonstrate the application of the idea and how the approach and methods of the experiment can be transferred.

### Instructions
The accompanying report to this solution must have the following aspects. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the full outline of the grading criteria (located in Module Resources):

- Brief information on the business context (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%).
- Justification of the choice of dataset (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%).
- Justification of the approach to developing the prediction model (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10% and Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%).
- Rationale for the machine learning algorithms used (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%).
- Analysis of the outputs with evidence of testing (Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, critically weighted at 10%).
- Demonstration that the application of the approach and methods developed from this experiment can be applied to the problem identified in the Unit 9 report (critically weighted at 15%).
- The presentation and structure of your work (weighted at 25%) includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading and correct use (and format) of citations and references. 

### Deliverables
Your only deliverable/submission is the implementation report with the above content.  The report should include screenshots of the outputs from your model on WEKA, as an appendix, which will be reviewed in line with the points above.  A link to the dataset used should be included in your report.
