<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p> Artificial neural network (ANN) is a biology inspired algorithm that, like animal brain, can learn from the environment and adapt itself to make more correct decisions. At present, ANN and its variant algorithm is used widely in different areas of our lives, from marketing to automation. ANN is a key driver for the industry 4.0 revolution, where machines are making decisions with minimal or no human interactions.</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p> The unit provided me with a solid understanding of neural networks including different functions used in ANN.</p>

<h2>Perceptron Activities</h2>
<p>Check out the GitHub link below for more details. The simple perceptron produces outputs of either 0 or 1. A single-layer perceptron (without hidden layers) was trained to perform binary classification for the AND operation. In contrast, a multi-layer perceptron, utilizing a hidden layer and sigmoid activation function, was used to solve the XOR problem.
