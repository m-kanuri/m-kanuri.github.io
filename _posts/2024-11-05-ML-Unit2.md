<h2>Correlation and Regression</h2>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is valuable to data science (and AI) projects since it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts. Such level of certainty can be achieved only after raw data is validated and checked for anomalies, ensuring that the data set was collected without errors. EDA also helps to find insights that were not evident or worth investigating to business stakeholders and data scientists but can be very informative about a particular business.

EDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning. Once data scientists become familiar with the data set, they often have to return to feature engineering step, since the initial features may turn out not to be serving their intended purpose. Once the EDA stage is complete, data scientists get a firm feature set they need for supervised and unsupervised machine learning.</p>

The task was to run the shared programmes in the Jupyter Notebook download from the Essex Software Hub or via Google Colab and change variables as needed to observe how the change in data points impacts correlation and regression.
