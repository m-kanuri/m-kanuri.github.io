<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is valuable to data science (and AI) projects since it allows to get closer to the certainty that the future results will be valid, correctly interpreted, and applicable to the desired business contexts. Such level of certainty can be achieved only after raw data is validated and checked for anomalies, ensuring that the data set was collected without errors. EDA also helps to find insights that were not evident or worth investigating to business stakeholders and data scientists but can be very informative about a particular business..</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> In this unit, we started a journey into the world of exploratory data analysis. We learned different methods to understand raw data, spot unusual patterns, and prepare it for more analysis. The practical exercises gave us useful hands-on experience.</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of this unit, I improved my skills in organizing and visualizing data, giving me the tools I need to find useful information in complicated datasets.</p>
