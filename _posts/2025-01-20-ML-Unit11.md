<h2>Unit Overview</h2>
<p>This unit allows for an understanding of model selection and evaluation, which is a hugely important procedure in the machine learning workflow. Selection of correct model(s) is like selecting the correct tool(s) to do a specific job, which in machine learning case is prediction or classification. Once selected, we must evaluate the model(s) based on their performance. When we evaluate our model(s), we gain a greater insight into what it predicts well and what it does not, and this helps us turn it from a model that predicts our dataset with a 65% accuracy level to closer to 80% or 90%.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Model selection and evaluation was the topic of this unit, we learned to evaluate model performance and select the right model for the task.</p>
  
<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>I gained the ability to evaluate model performance and select models based on established metrics so I can make informed decisions in machine learning projects.</p>
  
<h2>Assignment -Model Performance Measurement</h2>
<p> Run the model_Performance_Measurement.ipnyb file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error.</p>
