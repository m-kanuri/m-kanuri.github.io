<h2>Unit Overview </h2>
<p>This unit provides a visual representation of CNN with interactive capability to immerse with the CNN algorithm. This interactive platform also allows you to restructure the algorithm, as well as carry out other forms of updating (bias, weight).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hands-on experimentation with CNNs was the highlight of this unit, where we explored different configurations and observed their impact on model performance.</p>

<h2>My Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>This unit boosted my practical skills in working with CNNs, equipping me with the ability to iteratively refine model architectures for optimal performance..</p>
