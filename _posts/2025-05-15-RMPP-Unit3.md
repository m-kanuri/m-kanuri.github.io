 <h2>Research Proposal Review</h2>
    
    <p>Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
        <li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
        <li>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations will be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in unit 10.</p>
