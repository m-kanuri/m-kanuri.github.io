# Data Activity7

Using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 2013-2014: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset, perform the following activities:

Create a crosstab to assess how individualsâ€™ experience of any crime in the previous 12 months bcsvictim vary by age group agegrp7. Create the crosstab with bcsvictim in the rows and agegrp7 in the columns, and produce row percentages, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Looking at the crosstab you have produced, which age groups were the most likely, and least likely, to be victims of crime?
