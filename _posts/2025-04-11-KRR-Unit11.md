<h2>Assignment Details</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you are tasked with employing the Protégé software (download or web version) to construct a prototype ontology as the backbone for an AI-driven job-matching service. This service matches job seekers with suitable employment opportunities, aligning with their individual skills, experiences, and preferences.</p>
<p>Through this practical application, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore and critique formal approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning.</li>
<li>Assess the ontology's foundational role in AI applications.</li>
<li>Evaluate the properties and modelling techniques of the knowledge-based system you develop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your analysis should demonstrate a deep understanding of ontology's impact on the efficacy of the AI service, highlighting its strengths and identifying any potential improvements. This hands-on experience aims to develop your proficiency in the following key areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Critiquing the necessity and effectiveness of formal knowledge representation methods (Learning Outcome 1).</li>
<li>Conducting a critical review of your system's properties to ensure its robustness and reliability (Learning Outcome 2).</li>
<li>Appraising the ontology modelling techniques you utilise for their applicability and potential in addressing real-world problems (Learning Outcome 3).</li>
</ul>
