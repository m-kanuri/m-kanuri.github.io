<h2> Formative Activities </h2>
<h3> Collaborative Discussion 3: Deep Learning  </h3>
<p>Collaborative Learning Discussion 3 (Continued). Provide a summary post in the discussion in Unit 9. Please label this as ‘Summary Post’. It should be 300 words. </p>
    <h3> My Learning Outcomes </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summarised and covered as part of Unit 9.</p>

<h2> Assessment </h2>
<h3>Development Individual Project: Presentation</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a practical development of your design from Unit 6.</li>
  <li> The presentation should consist of a PowerPoint deck of up to 10 slides along with a transcript of the audio file.</li>
 <li> You should submit a fully tested set of code with all required libraries. Your code should be well documented with in-line commentary or self-document code as appropriate. Remember that comments should explain why you have made certain choices, rather than what the code does.</li>
 <li> You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how key aspects of your code work (via demos, screenshots and output captures). This means that you should show some key elements of your code in action to demonstrate that it runs correctly and as expected.</li>
 <li> You should include comprehensive evidence of testing including output from test tools (e.g. unit testing) demonstrating correct code and functional testing with any remediation activity documented as well.</li>
 <li> You should include comprehensive evidence of testing including output from test tools (e.g. unit testing) demonstrating correct code and functional testing with any remediation activity documented as well.</li>
  <li>Please Note: In addition to the PowerPoint deck and audio file (more information below), you should also submit a README file that documents how the application runs.</li>
</ul>
<h3> My Learning Outcomes </h3>

<h4>Outcome 1</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I applied principles of agent-oriented and object-oriented programming to design and implement the Intelligent Forensics Agent. Developing the File Locator component helped me understand how modular architecture and reactive pipelines can improve system reliability and maintainability.</p>

<h4>Outcome 2</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By integrating libraries such as psutil, python-magic, and SQLite, I learned how to combine multiple Python tools into a cohesive workflow for safe discovery, content-based identification, and metadata storage. This experience strengthened my ability to justify design choices based on both technical performance and ethical considerations.</p>

<h4>Outcome 3</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Through implementing and testing the code, I gained practical experience with unit testing, coverage analysis, and debugging. Analysing test results taught me the importance of iterative improvement, code quality, and reproducibility — ensuring that the system not only works but remains transparent and auditable.</p>

<h4>Outcome 4</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting on the ethical and forensic aspects of this project deepened my understanding of responsible AI and software design. Applying principles like data minimisation, auditability, and human oversight helped me ensure that the agent functions effectively while respecting privacy and evidential integrity.</p>
