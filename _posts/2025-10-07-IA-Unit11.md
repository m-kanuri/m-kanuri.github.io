<h2> Assessment </h2>
<h3>Development Individual Project: Presentation</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a practical development of your design from Unit 6.</li>
  <li> The presentation should consist of a PowerPoint deck of up to 10 slides along with a transcript of the audio file.</li>
 <li> You should submit a fully tested set of code with all required libraries. Your code should be well documented with in-line commentary or self-document code as appropriate. Remember that comments should explain why you have made certain choices, rather than what the code does.</li>
 <li> You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how key aspects of your code work (via demos, screenshots and output captures). This means that you should show some key elements of your code in action to demonstrate that it runs correctly and as expected.</li>
 <li> You should include comprehensive evidence of testing including output from test tools (e.g. unit testing) demonstrating correct code and functional testing with any remediation activity documented as well.</li>
