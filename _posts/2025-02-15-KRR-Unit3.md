<h2>Activity 1</h2>

<p>Attempt the following questions from the module core text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 Question 4 - The barber's paradox.</li>
<li>Chapter 3 Question 4 - A Canadian variant of an old puzzle.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Activity 2</h2>
<p>Read the paper by Palomino et al (2005) and review the ‘crossing problem’ diagram provided in the Lecturecast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a set of statements in first order logic (FOL) that represent the states shown – for example you may define two functions left and right and therefore the first state could be represented as: Left(F) and left(W) and Left(G) and left(C). Define your own set of FOL statements for the entire diagram.</li>
<li>You have been provided with solutions to the ‘crossing problem’ written in Lisp (here), Prolog (here) and Maude (here). Compare your FOL clauses with the various implementations – which of the implementations provides the closest match to your FOL version?</li>
</ul>
