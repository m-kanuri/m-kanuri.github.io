**Unit 4 Assignment**

1) Run each step of the demo correlation regression fuelconsumption.ipynb with data from FuelConsumption.csv and China_gdp.csv
2) Using data from Global_Population.csv & Global_GDP.csv undertake the following tasks
3) Task A: Correlation: Pre-process the data â€“ mean population of each country and mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021) by making some arrangements for the missing values (HINT: You will need to use the datasets Global_GDP.csv and Global_Population.csv). Investigate any correlation between the mean population of each country and the mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021). Very briefly, interpret the generated plot. Evaluate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
4) Task B: Regression: Perform linear regression, where the independent variable is the mean population of each country (from 2001 to 2021), and the dependent variable is the mean per capita GDP (from 2001 to 2021).
