## Learning Outcomes

Understand the applicability and challenges of using machine learning algorithms with different datasets.

## My Learning

This week, we examined correlation and regression, paying particular attention to their measurement and some practical examples of their use. By the end of the week, I had a conceptual grasp of correlation and regression and gained insight into measures of these occurrences. Subsequently, I was able to use correlation and regression for practical purposes in many real situations and apply these techniques to data analysis and its interpretation.
